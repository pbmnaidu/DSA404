/**
 * Compatibility shim — extra/alternative practice problems now live in
 * `practice-problems.ts`, generated from the DSA_500 workbook (PRACTICE_500 tab),
 * the single source of truth. This file adapts that shape to the older
 * `EXTRA_PROBLEMS`/`Sheet` interface so the rest of the app doesn't need to change.
 *
 * Do NOT add problems here directly — edit the source spreadsheet and
 * regenerate `practice-problems.ts` instead.
